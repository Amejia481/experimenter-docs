# Hey there Nimbus customers! 

It’s been an exciting month for the Nimbus team - we have made lots of progress on our capabilities on mobile and have made new improvements to the experimenter intake form. 

    It’s now easy to experiment on mobile applications (Fenix, and iOS) without having to go through the entire product cycle! 🎉 Experiment owners can now run experiments and iterate on them really quickly. Watch James run an experiment comparing “fancy settings” and “emoji settings” in his great demo. 


    We’re making it simpler to launch experiments. To empower you all to experiment, and to be self-sufficient in experimentation, we want to help you mitigate the risks associated with experimentation. We’ve added three main risk mitigations to the UI, and we will automatically tell you if we recommend you get a sign off, and who you should contact if so. See how this works in more detail in Les’s demo.


    We’ve also noticed that when launching an experiment, it can be difficult to identify if you are missing required information, so we have added new error handling capabilities. With these improvements, you will never have to ponder 🤔 what you’re missing; instead, there are visual cues to know when you are ready! Lauren runs us through the entire workflow here. 


    We’ve also made some new changes to our desktop API. You’ll find more information on the Firefox 90 updates in our docs hub. 


Thanks all!
The Nimbus team.
