Welcome to the [Experimenter](https://experimenter.services.mozilla.com/nimbus/) documentation hub! The goal of this website is to serve as a central location for documenting and linking to documentation of all things Experimenter, Nimbus, Jetstream, and related SDKs.

You will find documentation pages linked in the sidebar, and all external links are denoted with an external icon.

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).

Want to edit one of these docs, add a new one, or modify the sidebar? Check out the [Contributing](/contributing) page.

## Getting started

Want to run an experiment in Firefox? Here's what you should do first:

- Follow the [Experiment Design Process](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/x/XdTNBw) to work with Data Science on your hypothesis and experiment design.
- Go through onboarding to use the [Nimbus Console](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/FJT/Nimbus+Onboarding#NimbusOnboarding-Branches)
